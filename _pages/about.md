I am a research-oriented postgraduate student in Computational Pathology at the [Peking University Third Hospital](https://www.puh3.net.cn/). I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Zhou. My research interests lie in predicting cancer prognosis and metastasis from histopathological whole-slide images, with a particular focus on the alignment and fusion of multimodal data.
